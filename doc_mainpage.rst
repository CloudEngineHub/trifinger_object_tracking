   :alt: Example showing the result of the pose detection.

Multi-camera pose estimation of coloured cuboids for the TriFinger robots.

Detect coloured cuboids (with a different colour on each side) using images from
three cameras.  This is used for object detection in the TriFinger robot
platforms but could also be used in other settings with multiple cameras.
